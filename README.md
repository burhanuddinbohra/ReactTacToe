# ReacTacToe

## Overview
**ReacTacToe** is a dual-player Tic Tac Toe game built with ReactJS. Players can edit and change their names, which assigns them their corresponding game turn symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game logs each move made by the players and displays an appropriate message when the game ends, indicating the winner or if it's a draw. A "Rematch" button allows users to restart the game in both scenarios.

This project is multi-device compatible and was developed to learn the basics of ReactJS, utilizing key concepts such as `useState`, custom components, props, two-way binding, lifting the state up, and more.

## Features
- Dual-player game with editable player names.
- Real-time assignment of game turn symbols ('X' or 'O').
- Move log tracking for the current game.
- Displays game result (win/draw) with an option to rematch.
- Multi-device compatibility.

## Learning Objectives
This project was developed to explore and understand the following ReactJS concepts:

- **useState**: Manage state within components.
- **Custom Components**: Build reusable and modular UI components.
- **Props**: Pass data between components.
- **Two-way Binding**: Synchronize data between the UI and the state.
- **Lifting State Up**: Share state between multiple components.
